<h1 align = 'center'>Extracting Data From Files</h1>

 -  As a data scientist for a climate research organization, I want to update some models. Where I need to extract temperature data for 3 regions being monitored. Unfortunately the temperature reading devices are quite old and can only be configured to dump data each day into a folder called /temps on the server. Each file contains the daily temperature for each region.

<h1 align = 'center'>My Build Directory Automation</h1>

 - One common use of bash scripts is for releasing a “build” of source code. Sometimes the private source code may contain developer resources or private information that they don’t want to release in the published version.
 In this project, I've created a release script to automate coping certain files from a source directory into a build directory.
