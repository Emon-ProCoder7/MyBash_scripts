# My Build Directory Automation

 - One common use of bash scripts is for releasing a “build” of source code. Sometimes the private source code may contain developer resources or private information that they don’t want to release in the published version.
 In this project, I've created a release script to automate coping certain files from a source directory into a build directory.
